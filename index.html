	<h1>For People Who Demand Better
</h1>
<p>Families need good health more than ever.<br><br>

Real science. The best ingredients. And great taste.<br><br>

Sounds simple, right? Sure. But behind these simple concepts are years of scientific research, innovation, and design. Areas that othercompanies take shortcuts in - but not us.<br><br>

That's why 70,000+ people made the switch to First Day.<br><br>

Stop settling for the sugar bombs disguised as vitamins. Or the outdated formulas filled with unnecessary fillers.<br><br><br>

Demand better.</p></div>
